"This is the 10th time I've had to do this. Surely we can automate it?"

These words became something of a mantra at our startup. 

Naked Bus was growing at between 25-40% per year and we didn't want to keep adding staff, so we looked at smarter ways of doing things. And, although there was a lot of automation, it was also analysing customer queries, putting the right information on the website at point of sale, and changing driver scripts so customers weren't confused. And rinse, and repeat.

And we measured: complaints per 1,000 customers, delay minutes and so on. And we improved, and then measured again. 

One metric that demonstrated what we had achieved. In 2008, our first full time staff member turned to me and said, "Hamish, we need to employ dedicated customer service reps to answer calls and emails, so we can focus on growing the business." I reluctantly agreed, and we employed two, for a network carrying 100,000 people a year. In 2015, carrying 700,000 customers a year, we had ... still two customer service reps.

Oh, and all those improvements positively impacted on our customer service - we had a net promoter score of +65, which led to more word of mouth, more customers, fuller buses ... and lower costs per passenger. A neat virtuous circle when you have a single minded focus, or if you are just plain lazy.
